# regression_microdust_prediction
Can we predict the microdust level in Seoul?

The objective of the project is to understand corelation of microdust and other variables that we can access from public database. 
Multiple models were used for the prediction: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM.
The study is planned to be continued until the end of the year since having a full year of data for the test-set will give us more accurate evaluation of the model.

Note:
- The respositoy includes all necessary files and Jupyter Notebook codes.
- If you are interested in the 'Analysis & Prediction' Part, checkout the file "Microdust_Project_Prediction_170824.ipynb".
- Data importing and prepocessing part is also written on the other notebook file: :Microdst_Project_Tempalte_Builder_170824.ipynb"
